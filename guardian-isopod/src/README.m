# Guardian Isopod

A companion toy modeled after an isopod’s defensive ball form.

- 🌀 **Ball mode:** rolls up and acts like a bouncy ball
- 🛡️ **Guardian mode:** glows softly and “watches over” the child
- 🐚 **Emotional logic:** responds to touch, noise, shaking, and proximity

This repo holds the behavior / state machine that could run inside
a physical toy or a digital prototype (game, app, or simulation).
