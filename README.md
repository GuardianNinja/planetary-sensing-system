# Planetary Sensing – Triple Verification Scaffold

This repo holds a minimal, conceptual implementation of the
triple‑verification loop for a planetary sensing system.

It includes:

- Jarvondis – structural and network logic checks
- Krystal – clarity and pattern checks
- Miko – experience and human‑facing safety checks
- Gyroscopic firewall – rotating, pseudo‑random emphasis for basic hygiene

This code is a **conceptual scaffold**, not production‑grade security or
scientific code. It’s meant for:

- Designing protocols
- Teaching collaborators
- Prototyping interfaces
- Iterating on the guardian‑network logic

Extend, refactor, or replace pieces as needed.
